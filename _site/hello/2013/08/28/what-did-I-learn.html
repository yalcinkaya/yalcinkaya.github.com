            <h1>What did I learn about my self?</h1>
            28 Aug 2013


            <p>My emotional states shape my attitude. My attitude shapes my experience. When I smoke weed, I get a new perspective. When I use x, I am very happy, friendly and comfortable to be myself around people.</p>

<p>The feelings emerge from using stimulants and they only there for a limited time. With the observing self, I can learn from these experiences and change consciously.</p>

<p>Although, I don&#8217;t feel how I felt on Friday now, I can still remember it. I had the will and strength to dig deeper into the nagging feelings that I had around being with Anna and sex. Suddenly everything made sense. I don&#8217;t remember how the thought process was but the feeling of peace, relaxation and love was right there. Here&#8217;s what I can recall;</p>

<p>Anna is a very important part of my life. I never wanted to have sex with someone although our sex life is hanging of the cliff. Thinking about someone feels like I am conflicting myself, although I don&#8217;t know why yet.</p>

<p>I have a duty to myself to be the person that I want to be. I feel this is my opportunity to grow mindfully and be someone that I am 100% happy to be.</p>

<p>The two are not conflicting with each other they are just tangled. There is a risk associated with changing personalities in terms maintaining my relationship with Anna. However, I feel like that risk can be mitigated if I keep the communication lines open with her and if she does the same too.</p>

<p>This Friday I was free from the nagging internal talk and I was happy. I don&#8217;t know how but i even managed to hangout with people that didn&#8217;t speak english. I had good time with my brothers and other people that we met casually.</p>
