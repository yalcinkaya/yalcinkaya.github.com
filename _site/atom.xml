   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bronnie Ware is an Australian nurse who spent many years working in palliative care caring for those who were dying. She eventually published a book called the The Top Five Regrets of the Dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I&amp;#8217;d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I hadn&amp;#8217;t worked so hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I&amp;#8217;d had the courage to express my feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish that I had let myself be happier.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My emotional states shape my attitude. My attitude shapes my experience. When I smoke weed, I get a new perspective. When I use x, I am very happy, friendly and comfortable to be myself around people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feelings emerge from using stimulants and they only there for a limited time. With the observing self, I can learn from these experiences and change consciously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, I don&amp;#8217;t feel how I felt on Friday now, I can still remember it. I had the will and strength to dig deeper into the nagging feelings that I had around being with Anna and sex. Suddenly everything made sense. I don&amp;#8217;t remember how the thought process was but the feeling of peace, relaxation and love was right there. Here&amp;#8217;s what I can recall;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna is a very important part of my life. I never wanted to have sex with someone although our sex life is hanging of the cliff. Thinking about someone feels like I am conflicting myself, although I don&amp;#8217;t know why yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a duty to myself to be the person that I want to be. I feel this is my opportunity to grow mindfully and be someone that I am 100% happy to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two are not conflicting with each other they are just tangled. There is a risk associated with changing personalities in terms maintaining my relationship with Anna. However, I feel like that risk can be mitigated if I keep the communication lines open with her and if she does the same too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Friday I was free from the nagging internal talk and I was happy. I don&amp;#8217;t know how but i even managed to hangout with people that didn&amp;#8217;t speak english. I had good time with my brothers and other people that we met casually.&lt;/p&gt;
